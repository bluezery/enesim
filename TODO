+ Make use of the flags on the surface draw function
+ We need to optimize and avoid the need to always call
  enesim_renderer_data_get(r) whenever we want to render a span, for such, extend such function
  to receive the data already fetch with enesim_renderer_data_get(r) but on the surface_draw
+ Change very renderer to use *thiz* as the variable for itself
+ We need to get rid of the hypot function, it is used on a lot places
  but with f16p16 values
+ We need to use the real types on the rendering functions
+ We need to simplify the real rendering functions into its own
  c file with its own struct, this way in the future we can reuse the
  algorithm for other backends
+ Split the hswitch and transition common parts into a common transition renderer
  with properties as src, target and step, that's all
+ This one is important, is time to worry about the memory, given that renderers can go inside others
  and so forth, why not instead of doing enesim_delete we do enesim_ref/unref, this might do our lifes
  easier
  already done:
  other/compound
  other/clipper
  shape/shape
  transition/transition
+ Normalize the stride/pitch
+ Initialize every renderer to some sane vales
