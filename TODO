+ Fix every renderer to use the normal "external" way to define a new renderer
+ Make use of the flags on the surface draw function
+ Given that we'll change every rennderer to use the API to define a new renderer instead
  of using the internals, we need to optimize and avoid the need to always call
  enesim_renderer_data_get(r) whenever we want to render a span, for such, extend such function
  to receive the data already fetch with enesim_renderer_data_get(r) but on the surface_draw
  The renderers already done are:
	gradient/gradient.c
	gradient/linear.c
	gradient/radial.c
	D shape/path.c
	D shape/shape.c
	D shape/circle.c
	D shape/ellipse.c
	D shape/figure.c
	D shape/rectangle.c
	D filter/hswitch.c
	D filter/dispmap.c
	D filter/transition.c
	D filter/raddist.c
	D pattern/grid.c
	D pattern/stripes.c
	D pattern/checker.c
	D other/importer.c
	D other/perlin.c
	D other/image.c
	D other/compound.c
	D other/background.c
+ Change very renderer to use *thiz* as the variable for itself
+ Rename every enesim_renderer_surface_draw() with enesim_renderer_draw()
+ Implement a threaded draw() function
+ We need to get rid of the hypot function, it is used on a lot places
  but with f16p16 values
+ We need to use the real types on the rendering functions
+ We need to simplify the real rendering functions into its own
  c file with its own struct, this way in the future we can reuse the
  algorithm for other backends
