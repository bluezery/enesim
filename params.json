{"name":"Enesim","tagline":"Drawing library","body":"### Introduction\r\nEnesim is a rendering library and provides a complete solution for drawing, allocating, compositing and converting pixels. All of the systems of the library are flexible enough to support drawing capabilities on any scenario.\r\n\r\nThe most useful system is the the Renderer system, which allows you to draw different graphics primitives (in Enesim it is called a Renderer) into a target drawable (in Enesim a Surface). Given that a Renderer can draw anything, it has its own state that is modified through the renderer's specific properties setters and getters.\r\n\r\n### Backends\r\n* Software based\r\n* OppenGL\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nFor the API reference check the [doxygen] (http://enesim.org/docs/) generated documentation\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\nFor some examples on how to use the library and the generated images check the [examples](http://enesim.org/docs/examples.html) page at the documentation.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n* Eina\r\n* Fontconfig\r\n* Freetype\r\n* GLew\r\n* libpng\r\n* libjpg\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
